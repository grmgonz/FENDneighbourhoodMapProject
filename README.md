Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 5: Neighbourhood Map Project
===============================
I built a single-page web application,using the Knockout framework, that displays a Google Map of an area and various points of interest. Users can search all included landmarks and, when selected, additional information about a landmark is presented from the FourSquare and Wikipedia APIs.
